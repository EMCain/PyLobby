This is a Python project to explore the [lobbying data on Open Secrets](https://www.OpenSecrets.org/federal-lobbying/). I eventually want to create a browser extension around this API, but I'm starting in Python since I understand it better. I may create a Python app as an ETL and API backend (probably Flask) for a browser extension. 

OpenSecrets.org is a project of the Center for Responsive Politics. The CRP has not endorsed PyLobby in any way. 

looks like there's a basic Python API project for this already, I may use it at some point. https://github.com/robrem/opensecrets-crpapi
